    <p><em>Comfort-first accessories for happy little ones.</em></p>

    <h2 id="learn-more">Why Lullaby Locks Feels Different</h2>
    <p>Lullaby Locks was created out of a parent’s wish: find hair accessories that treat little heads with kindness. From newborn headbands to tween-friendly clips, the brand prioritizes soft, hypoallergenic materials and thoughtful designs so parents don’t have to choose between safety and style.</p>

    <h3>Comfort & Safety — First, Always</h3>
    <p>Every piece is built for sensitive skin: non-irritating fabrics, snag-free seams, and secure finishes that sit gently without pinching. These tiny details keep irritation and red marks at bay, giving parents peace of mind during everyday wear and special moments alike.</p>

    <h3>Designs that Grow With Your Child</h3>
    <p>Lullaby Locks offers age-tailored collections — baby, toddler, kid, and tween — and understands that what works for a newborn won’t always suit an active 7-year-old. The range mixes playful accents with subtle sophistication, inspired by French and Korean aesthetics so outfits look finished without fuss.</p>

    <h3>Benefits for Parents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy-to-wear pieces that stay put during playtime</li>
      <li>Durable construction for repeated washing and daily use</li>
      <li>Affordable price points so you can stock up without stress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real (and Relatable) — A Tiny Story</h2>
    <p>One evening, new parent Priya dressed baby Aria for her first family photos. Between diaper changes and lullabies, Priya worried a headband would irritate Aria’s soft skin. To her relief, the Lullaby Locks pearl headband stayed perfectly in place, Aria smiled for the camera, and the family captured memories without a single tear. That one small detail turned a chaotic moment into a gentle memory.</p>

    <h2>Wrap-Up & Call to Action</h2>
    <p>If you’re looking for baby accessories that feel as good as they look, Lullaby Locks is a parent-first choice. Thoughtful materials, secure fits, and a curated aesthetic make each piece a little touch of luxury.</p>
